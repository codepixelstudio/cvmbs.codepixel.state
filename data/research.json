His laboratory investigates how reactive oxygen species induce pathological changes in arterial smooth muscle associated with hypertension. Results from this research aim to provide insight into understanding why clinical trials with antioxidant supplements generally produce negative results and thereby lead to new pharmacological tools for the clinical prevention and management of hypertension. Blocking the increased calcium channel function should prevent arterial contraction leading to high blood pressure and diseases such as stroke.  Events underlying altered calcium channel function during hypertension are being explored by a combination of total internal reflection fluorescence microscopy, voltage-clamp electrophysiology, fluorescent calcium imaging and video microscopy of intact arteries to seek new therapies for arterial disease."

Dr. Tobet\u2019s research program examines organization of clusters of neurons deep in the preoptic area and hypothalamus centers that act as key relay stations that control many homeostatic mechanisms (e.g. body temperature regulation) and motivated behaviors (e.g., feeding and drinking), and regulate many sex-dependent functions. Time-lapse video microscopy is used to observe cell movements in slices of embryonic brain tissue.  Additional projects involving motion of cells in the adult pituitary (gonadotropes) and ovary (follicles and ova) are interests in the lab particularly as related to developing microfluidic devices and biosensors for following molecular changes.  The Tobet laboratory employs techniques spanning in vivo to in vitro, molecular to cellular and behavioral."

Specific projects combine behavioral neuroscience, cardiovascular and endocrine physiology, and neurocircuit analysis to determine the mechanistic basis of stress effects on health. Current studies are particularly focused on the neurobiological mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular disease. Stress-induced changes in cardiovascular reactivity represent a significant detriment to long-term health and mortality. Changes in autonomic regulation following chronic stress may generate a predisposition to co-morbid depression and cardiovascular disease. To identify the neural substrates linking chronic stress, cardiovascular disease, and depression, my laboratory uses a variety of tools including optogenetics, radiotelemetry, immunohistochemistry, connectional anatomy, confocal microscopy, plasma hormone analysis, and social\/affective behavioral assays.

Her laboratory studies how neurons in the hypothalamus are regulated and how these neurons communicate synaptically with each other as well as other neurons in the larger neural networks that affect energy balance. Current studies are focused on the preopiomelanocortin neurons in the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus that play a critical role in maintaining energy balance through the release of the peptide alpha-MSH and thereby affect aspects of food reward through the release of the endogenous opioid beta-endorphin. These neurons also release classical neurotransmitters and endogenous cannabinoids. The primary methods used in the lab are patch clamp electrophysiology in brain slices and primary neuronal cell cultures, retrograde labeling by stereotaxic microinjection, immunofluorescence and confocal imaging in transgenic and knockout mice."

Dr. Tobet\u2019s research program examines organization of clusters of neurons deep in the preoptic area and hypothalamus centers that act as key relay stations that control many homeostatic mechanisms (e.g. body temperature regulation) and motivated behaviors (e.g., feeding and drinking), and regulate many sex-dependent functions. Time-lapse video microscopy is used to observe cell movements in slices of embryonic brain tissue.  Additional projects involving motion of cells in the adult pituitary (gonadotropes) and ovary (follicles and ova) are interests in the lab particularly as related to developing microfluidic devices and biosensors for following molecular changes.  The Tobet laboratory employs techniques spanning in vivo to in vitro, molecular to cellular and behavioral."

Specific projects combine behavioral neuroscience, cardiovascular and endocrine physiology, and neurocircuit analysis to determine the mechanistic basis of stress effects on health. Current studies are particularly focused on the neurobiological mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular disease. Stress-induced changes in cardiovascular reactivity represent a significant detriment to long-term health and mortality. Changes in autonomic regulation following chronic stress may generate a predisposition to co-morbid depression and cardiovascular disease. To identify the neural substrates linking chronic stress, cardiovascular disease, and depression, my laboratory uses a variety of tools including optogenetics, radiotelemetry, immunohistochemistry, connectional anatomy, confocal microscopy, plasma hormone analysis, and social\/affective behavioral assays.

Many of our studies are conducted in cultured neurons, a highly versatile system for analyzing synapse function. We also employ genetically modified mice to study cognitive function and diseases. We extensively employ techniques of cell biology, Calcium imaging, biochemistry, and behavioral analysis, as well as electrophysiology to deduce molecular mechanisms that control synapses."

If eyes are the windows into souls then C.elegans is a direct window into synaptic transport and function in an intact complete nervous system. The transparent nematode C.elegans with 302 neurons, a complete synaptic map, a short life span and an extensive library of genetic tools enables us to dive deep into the molecular mechanisms of learning and memory. The Hoerndli Lab uses genetic engineering, semi-automated behavioral analysis and most of all high resolution microscopy to directly observe and modify synaptic function in intact circuits of a living organism. Although very different from vertebrates at the circuit level, the molecular components and function of neurons is extremely conserved between vertebrates and C.elegans. This allows us to compare, contrast, and to define the fundamental mechanisms of synaptic function and memory. "

Our investigations include protein purification sequencing, examination of gene organization and sequence, specific gene transcriptional regulation, microarray assessment of gene expression, mRNA and protein expression, protein-protein interactions, as well as in vivo assessment of altered placental function.  More recently we developed lentiviral-mediated transgenic approaches that alter placental gene expression in vivo (Purcell et al., 2009).  This approach allows the specific targeting of gene expression solely in the placental trophoblast cells, and provides the mechanism to specifically study placental gene function in vivo in a variety of animal models, including the sheep, a very useful model for the in vivo study of placental and fetal physiology."

Specific projects combine behavioral neuroscience, cardiovascular and endocrine physiology, and neurocircuit analysis to determine the mechanistic basis of stress effects on health. Current studies are particularly focused on the neurobiological mechanisms linking depression and cardiovascular disease. Stress-induced changes in cardiovascular reactivity represent a significant detriment to long-term health and mortality. Changes in autonomic regulation following chronic stress may generate a predisposition to co-morbid depression and cardiovascular disease. To identify the neural substrates linking chronic stress, cardiovascular disease, and depression, my laboratory uses a variety of tools including optogenetics, radiotelemetry, immunohistochemistry, connectional anatomy, confocal microscopy, plasma hormone analysis, and social\/affective behavioral assays.

A main research component in the Foy lab is to interrupt the intense transmission of malaria and arboviruses by targeting the vector through their bloodmeals using drugs that attack vector physiology and that inhibit pathogen development or using anti-vector immunity driven by vaccination. The Foy lab is also developing mosquitoes and other vectors as biosurveillance tools, studying unique aspects of arbovirus transmission and arbovirus survival in vectors, and studying poorly understood mosquito pathogens for their prospects to become vector-borne disease control tools."

These infectious agents cause both important diseases of animals and models for human disease--i.e. leukemia, HIV infection\/AIDS, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease, BSE), and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. Research in the Hoover Lab led to development of the first successful and most widely used FeLV vaccine, now used to immunize cats worldwide against leukemia.

This viral protein is able to differentially regulate host transcription through mechanisms in common with a number of viral oncogenes. Although this research is largely grounded in the current dermal sarcoma model, full investigation of the molecular mechanisms will extend beyond the scope of this virus to include the Tax proteins of bovine and human leukemia viruses, and DNA tumor virus proteins: SV40 Tumor antigens, adenovirus E1A\/E1B, and papillomavirus E6\/E7."

Her laboratory studies viral-induced oncogenesis, in particular, a newly defined group of retroviruses from fish, which provide a model system of both oncogenesis and tumor regression.  For example, the walleye dermal sarcoma virus (WDSV) is a complex retrovirus encodes three viral accessory\/regulatory proteins that are involved in the induction of sarcomas that regress on a seasonal basis.  The biology of these tumors is associated with cyclic differences in the expression of viral transcripts and infectious virus. The Quackenbush lab seeks to determine the mechanisms by which the viral regulatory proteins control transcription, signal transduction, apoptosis, and transformation in the piscine systems. "

She uses a systems biology approach (metabolomics\/proteomics) combined with molecular virology, cell and structural biology, and biochemistry to study virus-host interactions. These viruses cause significant perturbations to the host metabolome to facilitate the formation of replication factories within specialized membrane structures. These structures are required for viral genome replication, assembly and egress. The host metabolome also fulfills the energy requirements for virus replication. Therefore, it is a key avenue to understand the dynamics of virus-host interactions. The goal of her research is to identify control points in cellular metabolic pathways that are required for virus replication, and evaluate these control points as novel targets for antiviral intervention."

The goal is to link research employing molecular, proteomic and genomic techniques to practical applications for controlling arthropod-borne diseases. A main research component in the Foy lab is to interrupt the intense transmission of malaria and arboviruses by targeting the vector through their bloodmeals using drugs that attack vector physiology and that inhibit pathogen development or using anti-vector immunity driven by vaccination. The Foy lab is also developing mosquitoes and other vectors as biosurveillance tools, studying unique aspects of arbovirus transmission and arbovirus survival in vectors, and studying poorly understood mosquito pathogens for their prospects to become vector-borne disease control tools."

These viruses cause significant perturbations to the host metabolome to facilitate the formation of replication factories within specialized membrane structures. These structures are required for viral genome replication, assembly and egress. The host metabolome also fulfills the energy requirements for virus replication. Therefore, it is a key avenue to understand the dynamics of virus-host interactions. The goal of her research is to identify control points in cellular metabolic pathways that are required for virus replication, and evaluate these control points as novel targets for antiviral intervention."

We are interested in understanding the sylvatic circulation of arboviruses in endemic areas, the involvement of vector and host populations in new geographic areas, and entomological risk factors surrounding such introductions. Our field and laboratory studies are focused on evaluation of the biological capacity of different mosquito species and populations to serve as efficient vectors, potential mechanisms for virus maintenance in mosquito populations, and the how the interactions of a mosquito species with vertebrate amplifying hosts over space and time may influence epizootic virus activity.  Additionally, we have an ongoing project to investigate the potential role of bats as arbovirus reservoirs and a source of emerging viruses."

Arbovirus infection can result in disease symptoms ranging from mild flu-like illness to debilitating encephalitis or death. Because arboviral infection is such a large health and socio-economic problem globally, my research has focused on finding ways to reduce human disease caused by these mosquito-borne viruses. We have a number of collaborative basic and translational research projects that involve flaviviruses (dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever) and alphaviruses (Sindbis, Chikungunya)."

These infectious agents cause both important diseases of animals and models for human disease--i.e. leukemia, HIV infection\/AIDS, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (mad cow disease, BSE), and Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. Research in the Hoover Lab led to development of the first successful and most widely used FeLV vaccine, now used to immunize cats worldwide against leukemia.

Drawing on his background in both immunology and prion biology, Dr. Zabel\u2019s research program focuses on the interaction of prions with cells and receptors of the immune system and lymphoid tissues in the early entry, trafficking, and pathogenesis phases of prion infections.  Little is known regarding the cell surface molecules and molecular co-factors that control these events.  Using mice engineered to transgenically express both the cervid or ovine normal prion protein gene and selected receptors of the innate immune system, the Zabel lab examines the early lymphoid system distribution of prions and employs vector systems expressing prion-targeted interfering RNA molecules as therapeutic strategies for prion infections.

My career has spanned everything from student to professor, research scientist to teacher. I have worked in a variety of locations including Wyoming, Florida, Oregon, and Alaska and with parasitologists from around the world, including Canada, Australia, Argentina, South Africa and countries in Europe. While most of my career has been research based, I am now enjoying being a Professor with primarily teaching responsibilities in training the upcoming generation of veterinarians."

The goal is to link research employing molecular, proteomic and genomic techniques to practical applications for controlling arthropod-borne diseases. A main research component in the Foy lab is to interrupt the intense transmission of malaria and arboviruses by targeting the vector through their bloodmeals using drugs that attack vector physiology and that inhibit pathogen development or using anti-vector immunity driven by vaccination. The Foy lab is also developing mosquitoes and other vectors as biosurveillance tools, studying unique aspects of arbovirus transmission and arbovirus survival in vectors, and studying poorly understood mosquito pathogens for their prospects to become vector-borne disease control tools."

These areas of study are applied in the development of animal models to better understand host-pathogen interaction, identification of factors influencing host susceptibility to infection, and for the identification of new host-directed treatment approaches. Among animal models of tuberculosis, our laboratory focuses primarily on the guinea pig model, which most accurately reflects the pathology of human patients with active tuberculosis. This model is currently being studied to better understand the mechanisms by which diabetes increases the risk of developing active tuberculosis disease, a comorbidity of emerging importance, especially in countries where tuberculosis is endemic. In conjunction with the laboratory of Dr. Randall Basaraba, we have developed the first guinea pig model of type 2 diabetes and diabetes-tuberculosis comorbidity. "

A main research component in the Foy lab is to interrupt the intense transmission of malaria and arboviruses by targeting the vector through their bloodmeals using drugs that attack vector physiology and that inhibit pathogen development or using anti-vector immunity driven by vaccination. The Foy lab is also developing mosquitoes and other vectors as biosurveillance tools, studying unique aspects of arbovirus transmission and arbovirus survival in vectors, and studying poorly understood mosquito pathogens for their prospects to become vector-borne disease control tools."

Nowadays we are expanding our basic research towards definition of differences in the origin and function of macrophage cell populations derived from mucosal and lymphoid organs. The main aim of this research is to associate particular characteristics from each macrophage cell subset derived from different organs with the development of adaptive immunity, inflammatory responses and susceptibility to mycobacteria infections."

Through proteomic and standard biochemical analysis, this work characterizes the molecular mechanism of exosome biogenesis. In the horse, transferrin receptor expression in serum exosomes is upregulated in a model of regenerative anemia.  (2) Diagnostic uses of plasma exosomes: Exosomes, subcellular particles secreted by cells into the circulation, provide a snapshot of cellular activity in distant sites, for example in the diagnosis of canine osteosarcoma.

For example, approximately 2\/3 of the world\u2019s population is at risk for infection by dengue virus, yellow fever virus, West Nile virus, or related flaviviruses. Arbovirus infection can result in disease symptoms ranging from mild flu-like illness to debilitating encephalitis or death. Because arboviral infection is such a large health and socio-economic problem globally, my research has focused on finding ways to reduce human disease caused by these mosquito-borne viruses. We have a number of collaborative basic and translational research projects that involve flaviviruses (dengue, West Nile, and yellow fever) and alphaviruses (Sindbis, Chikungunya)."

In the horse, transferrin receptor expression in serum exosomes is upregulated in a model of regenerative anemia.  (2) Diagnostic uses of plasma exosomes: Exosomes, subcellular particles secreted by cells into the circulation, provide a snapshot of cellular activity in distant sites, for example in the diagnosis of canine osteosarcoma.

This viral protein is able to differentially regulate host transcription through mechanisms in common with a number of viral oncogenes. Although this research is largely grounded in the current dermal sarcoma model, full investigation of the molecular mechanisms will extend beyond the scope of this virus to include the Tax proteins of bovine and human leukemia viruses, and DNA tumor virus proteins: SV40 Tumor antigens, adenovirus E1A\/E1B, and papillomavirus E6\/E7."

The biology of these tumors is associated with cyclic differences in the expression of viral transcripts and infectious virus.

These areas of study are applied in the development of animal models to better understand host-pathogen interaction, identification of factors influencing host susceptibility to infection, and for the identification of new host-directed treatment approaches. Among animal models of tuberculosis, our laboratory focuses primarily on the guinea pig model, which most accurately reflects the pathology of human patients with active tuberculosis. This model is currently being studied to better understand the mechanisms by which diabetes increases the risk of developing active tuberculosis disease, a comorbidity of emerging importance, especially in countries where tuberculosis is endemic. In conjunction with the laboratory of Dr. Randall Basaraba, we have developed the first guinea pig model of type 2 diabetes and diabetes-tuberculosis comorbidity. "

The research is proceeding on both an applied and a basic research track. On the applied track we are screening for inhibitors enzymes essential for M. tuberculosis cell wall synthesis, namely the enzymes that form dTDP-rhamnose, UDP-Galf, and UDP-GlcNAc. These inhibitors are tested for their ability to kill M. tuberculosis cells growing in culture and supplied to collaborators to incorporate into crystal structures of the relevant enzymes and to a medicinal chemist collaborator to make addition compounds. Compounds that do well against M. tuberculosis in culture are then tested in mice by Dr. Lenaerts of this department. On the basic research side we are studying the sugar transferases that use the sugar nucleotides above to build the cell wall as well as the enzymes that form the arabinofuranose residues of the cell wall.

He was previously a Senior Fellow in the Department of Microbiology at the University of Washington, School of Medicine (Seattle, WA), and earned his Ph.D. conducting microbiology research at the University of Wisconsin (Madison, WI). Highlights of his research career include the pioneering construction of metagenomic libraries to study antibiotic resistance and identification of novel biomolecules from unculturable bacteria. In addition, Dr. Borlee has patented quorum-sensing inhibitors for the development of anti-virulence drug leads. Dr. Borlee\u2019s discovery of a biofilm-induced bacterial adhesin that binds exopolysaccharides and reinforces biofilm structural integrity has been further developed by him into a c-di-GMP biosensor to identify and evaluate antibiofilm therapeutics."

These areas of study are applied in the development of animal models to better understand host-pathogen interaction, identification of factors influencing host susceptibility to infection, and for the identification of new host-directed treatment approaches. Among animal models of tuberculosis, our laboratory focuses primarily on the guinea pig model, which most accurately reflects the pathology of human patients with active tuberculosis. This model is currently being studied to better understand the mechanisms by which diabetes increases the risk of developing active tuberculosis disease, a comorbidity of emerging importance, especially in countries where tuberculosis is endemic. In conjunction with the laboratory of Dr. Randall Basaraba, we have developed the first guinea pig model of type 2 diabetes and diabetes-tuberculosis comorbidity. "

Both yeast and mammalian cell systems are employed in studies involving the induction, mechanisms, consequences and genetic control of DNA damage responses. Dr. Nickoloff collaborates with scientists in Japan, England, Germany, the University of Colorado, the University of Nebraska and the University of Florida to improve our understanding of normal and tumor cell responses to radiotherapy and chemotherapy."
